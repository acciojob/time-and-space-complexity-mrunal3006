	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p> In computer science, time complexity refers to the amount of time taken by an algorithm to complete its task as a function of the input size. It helps us understand how the algorithm's performance scales with larger inputs. An algorithm is considered efficient if it has a low time complexity, indicating that it can solve problems quickly even for larger datasets. Time complexity is often expressed using Big O notation, which provides an upper bound on the growth rate of the algorithm's running time.</p>
    <p> <strong>Space complexity</strong> is another critical aspect of algorithm analysis. It measures the amount of memory or storage space required by an algorithm to execute, also as a function of the input size. When we analyze space complexity, we are concerned with how much memory the algorithm uses at any point during its execution. Space complexity is commonly expressed in terms of Big O notation as well. For example, when an algorithm has a space complexity of O(n), it means that the amount of memory it uses grows linearly with the input size.
