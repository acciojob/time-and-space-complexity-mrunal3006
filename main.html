	<h1> Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity, efficient</p>
    <p> <b>Space complexity</b> is another critical aspect of algorithm analysis. It measures the amount of memory or storage  required by an algorithm to execute, also as a function of the input size. When we analyze, we are concerned with how much memory the algorithm uses at any point during its execution. It is commonly expressed in terms of Big O notation as well. For example, when an algorithm has of O(n), it means that the amount of memory it uses grows linearly with the input size.
